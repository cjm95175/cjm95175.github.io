### Github Actions - SECRETS

#### What is Github Secrets?
Secrets are essentially encrypted environment variables. Github Actions uses this variable within its workflows. Allows you to pass sensitive data. This data can be something like an API token, and/or any kind of information that is required for your application. The idea behind secrets, you can now pass this information through your CI/CD workflows, without having it easily readable within your yml file. 

#### Types
Shhhhh, I got tell you a secret. There are two tpes of secrets, that can be utilized within Github. There are repository secrets and organizational secrets. The repository secret, is a secret that can only be used within the repository it's set in. But what if you have a secret that needs to be access by multiple people within your organization? Well you geussed it, that's what the organizational secret is for. Instead of being set within one repo, it can be access across your organization and multiple repositories, within Github.
