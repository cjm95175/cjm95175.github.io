We all know that Amazon Web Services offer a wide array of tools and services that ease most general IT tasks. It's important to understand that Amazon has something called a Shared Respnsibility Model. Basically, you the user are responsible for maintaing the integrity of your data, and Amazon is responsible for the protection of said data while it's in their services. One of the first ways to ensure proper data security, User groups and policies need to be applied within AWS. This is most often done in the AWS Identity and Access Management module.

The AWS Identity and Access Management service allows you to control who can access certain resources, which resources can be accessed, and how resources can be accessed. And geuss what... it's free! One of the handful of services that Amazon provides to its users for absolutely 0 dollars.
