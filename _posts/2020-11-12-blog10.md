![]({{site.baseurl}}/https://blogs.tensult.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/AWS-IAM-1024x532.png)


We all know that Amazon Web Services offer a wide array of tools and services that ease most general IT tasks. It's important to understand that Amazon has something called a Shared Respnsibility Model. Basically, you the user are responsible for maintaing the integrity of your data, and Amazon is responsible for the protection of said data while it's in their services. One of the first ways to ensure proper data security, User groups and policies need to be applied within AWS. This is most often done in the AWS Identity and Access Management module.

The AWS Identity and Access Management service allows you to control who can access certain resources, which resources can be accessed, and how resources can be accessed. And geuss what... it's free! One of the handful of services that Amazon provides to its users for absolutely 0 dollars.

### AWS IAM: Major Components

- IAM User, a person or application that can authenticate with an AWS account
- IAM Group, a collection of IAM users that granted identical authorization
- IAM policy, a defines which resources and services can be access and the level of access to each resource
- IAM role, a tool that allows you to grant a set of temporary permissions for making AWS service request, kinda like sudo in Linux

### AWS IAM Multi Factor Authentication

This tool will require your AWS users to have an additional form of making sure they are who they say they are, essentially. MFA will definitely increase the security of your system, by just making it more difficult to break into an AWS account. The additional authentication method could be a specific MFA item given to the user. You can use Google Authenticator, or a U2F security key device. It's quite a versatile tool.
