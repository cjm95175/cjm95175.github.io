Recently I've started a Desktop Support Analyst position at UCLA Health, and there's a really interesting ticketing system being used. At first, it was quite foreign to me, especially since it's my first IT position, but after a few months of usage it's become my life! After doing a bit of research, and working with the product on a daily basis, I'll be covering all things ServiceNow.

ServiceNow, from what I can deduce, is a cloud-centric company that provides software for technical management support. ServiceNow specializes in IT operations management (ITOM), service management (ITSM), and business management (ITBM). It allows users to manage customer interactions, teams, projects, through a variety of plugins.
