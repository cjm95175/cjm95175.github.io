#### What is Github Actions?

	Github Actions is essentially a platform to automate development workflows. When researching this topic, I've come to realise that Github Actions is not just a CI/CD Pipeline tool, it automates many other developer workflows, but it's definitely best known for the CI/CD Pipeline use. What kind of workflows? Good question, and to simply answer it any workflow that is tedious and time consuming. Github Actions work in a way so whenever something happens in or to you project repository, a Github Event is triggered. Events like a pull request, issue & errors in code, a new contributor joining in, etc, all are considered an event. Then a preset action is executed as a response to the event. To break it down even further, you listen to an event, then an automatic workflow is triggered. Actions like, sort, label, assign, etc.
