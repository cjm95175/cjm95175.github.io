### Amzon Auto Scaling

#### What is an "Amazon Auto Scaling" ? 
Amazon Auto Scaling is a service, provided by the all mighty AWS, that enables you to automatically adjust computational resources to maintain performance for applications hosted on the AWS platform. Pretty nifty ain't? Yes, you probably already know this reader, but since I'll be handling this portion of my senior project, I'll be using this blog as a additional studying... Ehem.. 

Anyways, AWS Auto Scaling works in a way that automatically discovers and tracks the usage / performance of all your scalable resources, as expected. And I'm talking any scalable resource. This includes, but is not limited to:

- DynamoDB
- EC2 Spot Fleets
- Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) Auto Scaling groups
- Amazon Elastic Container Service

#### Benefits of Use

Well there are 3 main benefits of use, starting with everyone's favorite object, money! Well, saving it. The it's simple, resources not in use will not be used. You'd be just paying for what you need. Next you can setup and scale up or down very quickly. Way faster than the traditional route. AWS Auto Scaling lets you set target utilization levels for multiple resources in a single, intuitive interface. You can quickly see the average utilization of all of your scalable resources without having to navigate to other consoles. And then on top of that it allows you to make better scaling decisions. Now that's a weird term, but here me out. It lets you build and save scaling plans that uatomate how groups of certain resources respond to changes.

#### But what makes it special? 
So typically other scalable services, can only scale individual services. But in this case, AWS Auto Scaling service, can enable step scaling policies.AWS also provides an EC2 Auto Scaling tool, which enables you to scale groups of EC2 instances.

#### How It Work?
