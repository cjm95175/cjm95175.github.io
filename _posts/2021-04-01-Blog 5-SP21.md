### THE ONE THE ONLY DEPENDABOT

I was actually in the process of researching a Github action, for publishing to Github Pages, when i stumbled up the Dependabot. I thought it was interesting and thought it wouldn't hurt to include that in our project repo, and now I'm using it for a blog. Love it when things fall into place haha.

Anyways...

#### What do it do... also how, and why?

Well from what I've read and seen from other developers ( I am not claiming to be one lol), is that it essentially keeps your dependencies up to date. Which is actually quite a useful tool for developers. No longer having to "physically" update your package depencies, probably frees up more time for other things in the work day. 

Dependabot in Github Actions has:

- Nice Pull Requests
These PR requests put my own to shame. They include release notes, changelogs and commit links whenever they're available. They'll also automatically keep themselves conflict-free. Which is pretty nifty.

- Automated Security Notifications 
Wow it even automates security notifications for Ruby, JavaScript, PHP, Java, .NET, Python, Elixir and Rust. Pull Requests are automatically made in response to security advisories. 

- Compatility Scores
Dependabot aggregates everyone's test results into a compatibility score, so you can be certain a dependency update is backwards compatible and bug-free.
