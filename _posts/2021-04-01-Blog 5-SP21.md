### THE ONE THE ONLY DEPENDABOT

I was actually in the process of researching a Github action, for publishing to Github Pages, when i stumbled up the Dependabot. I thought it was interesting and thought it wouldn't hurt to include that in our project repo, and now I'm using it for a blog. Love it when things fall into place haha.

Anyways...

#### What do it do?

Well from what I've read and seen from other developers ( I am not claiming to be one lol), is that it essentially keeps your dependencies up to date. Which is actually quite a useful tool for developers. No longer having to "physically" update your package depencies, probably frees up more time for other things in the work day. 

Dependabot in Github Actions has:

- Nice Pull Requests


#### How it do dat?

It does what it does by automatically sends pull requests to your projects, against the depencies whenever upgrades occur.
