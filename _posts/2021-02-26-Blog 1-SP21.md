# Setting Up a Workflow With Github Actions

Previously we went over a general overview of Github Actions. Now it's time to do demonstrate Github Actions... in action lol. Today, or whatever time and day you're reading this blog, we'll be setting up CI with Github Actions.

### Overview: CI - Continuous Integration

CI is obviously the 1st part of the CI/CD pipeline workflow used in many development teams. CI stands for continous integration. It is essentially, when devlopers push the code to a code repository, a testing or build server checks the code as soon as it's pushed, then the devloper get's feedback about those tests. It allows you to find errors and bugs early.

### Demo Time

In this example we'll be assuming that our project already has a project repository in Github with a Dockerfile to then get our docker image, and that AWS ECR is already setup.

1. Create a configuration file. Since we're working with AWS, we'll call it "aws.yml". This file will be used to trigger the conintuous intergration pipeline. The file will be placed in you project repository, at **.github/workflows/** .

2. Fill in that file with the proper syntax. Since it's YAML it's pretty straight forward.
