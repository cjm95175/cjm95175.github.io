### Cloud Computing

What is Cloud Computing? Sounds like some weird meteorlogical event, where computers fly amongst the clouds. Sounds pretty dope. Sadly, this is not the case. I mean it's still a pretty cool endeavor, but not as cool as computers floating up in the clouds. Maybe one day. The reality of cloud computing is still pretty nifty!

Cloud Computing is, by definition, the delivery of different IT services through the internet. These services include data storage, server instances, networking tools, and software.

### Cloud Computing: Service Types
Cloud computing services are broken down into three major categories: software-as-a-service (SaaS), platform-as-a-service (PaaS) and infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS).
