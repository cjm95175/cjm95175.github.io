### Amazon Aurora

For this week, keeping in line with my project research, we'll be covering AWS's Amazon Aurora. Upon completeion of some Github Action workflows, I will be handling the Amazon Aurora. Whatever that means. Well I'll tell ya what that Amazon Aurora is all about.

Amazon Aurora is a relational database built for the cloud environment; compatible with MySQL and PostgresSQL. It is known for its high availability and open source characteristics. Making it a double edge relational database sword. 

Aurora pulls ahead the standard MySQL and PostgeSQL, in terms of speed. Being an Amazon AWS tool, it was built with not only speed in mind, but also security, and cost-efficiency. In addition, it works with AWS's Amazon Relational Database Service, automates traditional, time consuming, database management tasks.
