### What is an Ansible Playbook?

Remember Dockerfiles? Ansible Playbooks are the same, but different... Essentially you are placing coordinated instructions inside a YAML file, then let Ansible do the rest of the hard work. Previously, with server configuration management, in order to make a change to a group of servers, each server had to be configured indivudally. Even if they are part of the same group. There wasn't a good efficient way to push these configurations to a group of servers. Ansible and its playbooks have made it possible to do so. Allowing the system administrator to focus more on other tasks. 

Ansible playbooks can be as simple as running a series of commands on different servers in a sequence and rebooting in a specified sequence. They can also be used for more complex tasks such as deploying many virtual machines in a private cloud strucutre, or configuring web and database servers, load balancing, etc.
